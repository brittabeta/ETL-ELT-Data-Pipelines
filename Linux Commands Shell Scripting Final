## Scenario
## You are a lead linux developer at the top-tech company "ABC International INC." ABC currently suffers from a huge 
## bottleneck - each day, interns must painstakingly access encrypted password files on core servers, and backup those that 
## were updated within the last 24-hours. This introduces human error, lowers security, and takes an unreasonable amount of work.
## As ABC INC's most trusted linux developer, you have been tasked with creating a script backup.sh which automatically backs up 
## any of these files that have been updated within the past 24 hours.
## Objectives - Schedule shell script to run every 24 hours using crontab.

# This checks if the number of arguments is correct
# If the number of arguments is incorrect ( $# != 2) print error message and exit
if [[ $# != 2 ]]
then
  echo "backup.sh target_directory_name destination_directory_name"
  exit
fi

# This checks if argument 1 and argument 2 are valid directory paths
if [[ ! -d $1 ]] || [[ ! -d $2 ]]
then
  echo "Invalid directory path provided"
  exit

# [TASK 1]

destinationDirectory=2

# [TASK 2]

# The first argument is 1

# echo $currentTS

# current timestamp in seconds
# specifically seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC

# [TASK 4]
backupFileName="backup-$currentTS.tar.gz"
# backupFileName now would be
# echo $backupFileName
# backup-1681840649.tar.gz

# We're going to:
  # 1: Go into the target directory
  # 2: Create the backup file
  # 3: Move the backup file to the destination directory

# To make things easier, we will define some useful variables...

# [TASK 5]

# echo $origAbsPath

# [TASK 6]

# the absolute path of the destination directory
# /home/theia

# [TASK 7]
cd $origAbsPath # <- first go to original directory, then
cd $1 # <- target directory

# [TASK 8]

# to find files updated within the past 24 hours

declare -a toBackup
# declare variable toBackup, an array

  # [TASK 10] check if modified within last 24h
  if ((`date -r $file +%s` > $yesterdayTS))

    # [TASK 11] add to the toBackup array
    toBackup+=($file)

# [TASK 12] compress and archive the files

# [TASK 13] #backupFileName in working dir, move 
mv $backupFileName $destAbsPath
